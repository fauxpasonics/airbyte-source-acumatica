REQUIRED: SKILL LOADING PROTOCOL

Before writing any code, complete these steps in order:

1. SCAN each skill below and decide: LOAD or SKIP (with brief reason)
   - airbyte-cdk
   - poetry
   - docker
   - oauth
   - requests-mock

2. For every skill marked LOAD → immediately invoke Skill(name)
   If none need loading → write "Proceeding without skills"

3. Only after step 2 completes may you begin coding.

IMPORTANT: Skipping step 2 invalidates step 1. Always call Skill() for relevant items.

Sample output:
- airbyte-cdk: LOAD - building components
- poetry: SKIP - not needed for this task
- docker: LOAD - building components
- oauth: SKIP - not needed for this task

Then call:
> Skill(airbyte-cdk)
> Skill(docker)

Now implementation can begin.
